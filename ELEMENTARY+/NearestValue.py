'''
[A few clarifications]
If 2 numbers are at the same distance, you need to choose the smallest one;
The set of numbers is always non-empty, i.e. the size is >=1;
The given value can be in this set, which means that it’s the answer;
The set can contain both positive and negative numbers, but they are always integers;
The set isn’t sorted and consists of unique numbers.
